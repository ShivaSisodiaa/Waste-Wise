# Waste-Wise
A CNN classifier that can differentiate between recyclable and organic waste through the analysis of images.

This classifier is designed to help people identify the type of waste they are disposing of, thereby promoting responsible waste management.

Once the waste is classified, users are rewarded with digital points on our platform, which can be used to purchase goods from partnering brands. This incentivizes people to recycle and put waste where it belongs, while also promoting the use of digital currencies and reducing the carbon footprint associated with physical goods.

Through this project, we aim to create awareness about the importance of responsible waste management and promote the use of digital currencies in our daily lives. By deploying this model on Gradio, we ensure that it is accessible to a wide range of users and can be used to support the transition towards a sustainable future.

We believe that this solution has the potential to make a real difference and contribute towards the achievement of the sustainable development goals.

Our project can fulfill at least three sustainable development goals (SDGs):

Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production - By promoting responsible waste management and incentivizing recycling, your project can contribute towards achieving this goal.

Goal 13: Climate Action - Your project can help reduce the carbon footprint associated with waste disposal by encouraging responsible waste management.

Goal 17: Partnerships for the Goals - By collaborating with brands and promoting the use of digital currencies, your project can foster partnerships towards achieving the sustainable development goals.

Thank you for your attention.
